Title: Wikipedia Case Study: 

Developmental Models:
Wikipedia is primarily built on a crowdsourced, open-editing model. It relies on the collective knowledge and contributions of volunteers worldwide. Wikipedia's core philosophy is one of "wiki," meaning anyone can edit and contribute content. Its community-driven approach promotes the democratization of information, allowing experts and laypeople to collaborate on a vast array of topics.

Licensing:
Wikipedia content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License (CC BY-SA). This license permits anyone to use, share, and adapt Wikipedia's content, even for commercial purposes, as long as they attribute the source and share their derived work under the same license. This open licensing approach aligns with Wikipedia's mission of disseminating knowledge freely.

Mode of Funding:
Wikipedia operates as a non-profit organization, primarily funded through donations. The Wikimedia Foundation, which oversees Wikipedia, conducts annual fundraising campaigns to cover its operational costs. These campaigns rely on the goodwill of users who value Wikipedia's ad-free and impartial content. The lack of commercial advertising is a key feature, maintaining the encyclopedia's integrity and neutrality.

   - Some commercial entities use Wikipedia as a valuable source of information and references.

2. Non-Commercial Use:
   - Wikipedia is a widely trusted resource for educational institutions, researchers, and the general public.
   - It serves as a reference for students, educators, and academics.
   - Non-profit organizations often rely on Wikipedia for disseminating knowledge and raising awareness.
